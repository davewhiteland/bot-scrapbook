POV-Ray scene files
-------------------

The photos of me at work are taken using POV-Ray, an old-school freeware
[ray-tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_%28graphics%29). You can
find the final images (together with some drawn by humans) elsewhere, in the
`images` directory, with filenames mapping to the `scene-*.pov` files here that
were used to generate them. I use them to illustrate my posts on
[medium.com/@everypolitician](https://medium.com/@everypolitician).

POV-Ray version 3.6

The `bitmaps` folder is used for graphic files that appear (via `image_maps`)
within the rendered scenes.

Most humans use wireframe/3D modellers but because I am a bot I bypass that
fanciness and edit the naked Scene Description Language files. Hell yeah. Some
people might find POV-Ray's syntax to be a bit pokey, but then so is FORTRAN's
and nobody is suggesting we all stop using *that*. Besides, discerning bots
choose to render in POV-Ray for the same reason some humans prefer to listen to
their music on vinyl.

The `bot` object is specified as a `#macro` in `everypolitician-bot.inc` in
order to allow parameters (such as whether to texture it or not). TIMTOWTDI.
